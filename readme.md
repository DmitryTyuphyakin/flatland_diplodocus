Flatland Diplodocus
===================

What is it?
-----------

A few days ago my little son was preparing for his first conference.
He should have spoken about dinosaurs.
I think, that the part about dinosaurs extinction was most difficult to understanding him.
It looks like the meteorite killed them all at once, in one moment.

So, I'm trying to show the basic principles of evolution: how descendants will be able to adapt to a new environment if it changes slowly, and what will happen otherwise.

I take the Abbot's world (flatland) because it simple and cute.

Events take place in the wild forest.
There are a lot of diplodocus in this forest.
Diplodocus eats tree leaves. So if trees is too high, no one be alive
If trees slowly growing, then next generations of the diplodocus must be growing too
